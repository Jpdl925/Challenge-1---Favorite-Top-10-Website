                                    first heard it, but I love it even more knowing that there was truth and real story
                                    behind it too. Those are the kinds of night that leave us musicians with a whole
                                    other level of fulfillment when we break down for the night. You never know whose

                                    It's gospel night at the strip club, I've been sleepin' in my car<br>
                                    I lead the singin' service with a half-ass tuned guitar<br>
                                    And Brandy's singin' backup while Lonnie's tendin' bar<br>
                                    Just waitin' for more sinners to show up<br>
                                    Crystal just started dancin', she's always right on point<br>
                                    She don't mind if you don't tip her, as long as you slip her a joint<br>
                                    Patti's got an upper to get her through her shift<br>
                                    And a downer so she can lay down with the kids<br>
                                    Hallelujah, hallelujah<br>
                                    Jesus loves the drunkards and the whores and the queers<br>
                                    Hallelujah, hallelujah<br>
                                    Would you recognize Him if he bought you a beer?<br>
                                    Lonnie, he's a listener, he shoulda been a priest<br>
                                    It's the same confession on a barstool or your knees<br>
                                    He makes a mean Manhattan but he ain't drank since '93<br>
                                    Does the last call benediction then wipes the bar slate clean<br>
                                    Hallelujah, hallelujah<br>
                                    Jesus loves the drunkards and the whores and the queers<br>
                                    Hallelujah, hallelujah<br>
                                    Would you recognize Him if he bought you a beer?<br>
                                    The same old dirty dollars keep gettin' passed around<br>
                                    To whoever needs it most and I guess that's me right now<br>
                                    'Cause I'm starin' at this Jackson someone laid here at my feet<br>
                                    That's gas in my ol' Honda and somethin' warm to eat<br>
                                    Hallelujah (hallelujah), hallelujah (hallelujah)<br>
                                    Jesus loves the drunkards and the whores and the queers<br>
                                    Hallelujah (hallelujah), hallelujah (hallelujah)<br>
                                    He laid down a twenty and then he disappeared</p>

                                    It'll be fine by dusk light I'm telling you, baby<br>
                                    These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy<br>
                                    But when you place your head between my collar and jaw<br>
                                    I don't know much but there's no weight at all<br>
                                    And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't<br>
                                    'Cause if I say I miss you I know that you won't<br>
                                    But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun<br>
                                    Something in the orange tells me we're not done<br>
                                    To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am<br>
                                    Where the hell am I supposed to go?<br>
                                    I poisoned myself again<br>
                                    Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home<br>
                                    I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night<br>
                                    There's orange dancing in your eyes from bulb light<br>
                                    Your voice only trembles when you try to speak<br>
                                    Take me back to us dancing, this wood used to creak<br>
                                    To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am<br>
                                    Where the hell am I supposed to go?<br>

                                    The orange touches all things around<br>
                                    The grass, trees and dew, how I just hate you<br>
                                    Please turn those headlights around<br>

                                    that Miranda Lambert can't sing with, she has a voice that goes with anyone and
                                    anything she writes and sings!! I love Luke Combs he just keeps adding hit after
                                    hit! Teaming up with Miranda Lambert and actually hearing her actually sing with you
                                    is awesome!! I can see this winning duo of the year!! I love the song that her and
                                    Jason Aldean did, Drowns the Whiskey but she really didn't sing on that song! She
                                    just harmonized a little, but Out Running Your Memory is way better!! You two sound
                                    great together and should do more songs together!! Love Love Love!!</p>

                                    They play George Strait and they pour their doubles strong<br>
                                    I've been gone for two weeks now<br>
                                    There's some missing you in every little town<br>
                                    Ain't sure what I thought I'd find riding these yellow lines<br>
                                    Outrunnin' your memory is like outrunnin' the wind<br>
                                    I can't get where I'm going if I can't leave where you've been<br>
                                    I see you in every sunset, every star in the sky<br>
                                    I hear you callin' my name in the middle of the night<br>

                                    If I don't break down 'fore I make them LA lights<br>
                                    Been a thousand miles headed west and it's like I never left<br>

                                    Yeah, just last week I went to prison<br>
                                    To see some boys down on death row<br>
                                    Brought some guitars and my buddies<br>
                                    To play some songs I thought they'd know, huh<br>
                                    Yeah, I could feel myself tremblin'<br>
                                    When I shook one of their hands<br>
                                    I thought that he would be a monster<br>
                                    It turns out he's a whole lot like I am<br>
                                    Yeah, we talked huntin', we talked fishin'<br>

                            truck" as he's trying to keep things simple and take their time. The song's energetic melody

                                    I got turned around in some little town<br>
                                    I'd never been to before<br>
                                    Working my way through a middle-of-June<br>
                                    Midnight thunderstorm<br>
                                    There was something in the headlights<br>
                                    It stopped me on a dime<br>
                                    Well, she was scared to death, so I said<br>
                                    "Climb in, " and then she climbed<br>
                                    Oh, yeah<br>
                                    Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe<br>
                                    With a tear in her blood-stained shirt<br>
                                    She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to<br>
                                    I knew what had happened to her<br>
                                    I didn't load her down with questions<br>
                                    That girl had been through enough<br>
                                    I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes<br>
                                    And I asked her where he was<br>
                                    I don't know if he's an angel<br>
                                    'Cause angels don't do what he did<br>
                                    He was hellbent to find the man behind<br>
                                    All the whiskey scars I hid<br>
                                    I never thought my day of justice<br>
                                    Would come from a judge under a seat<br>
                                    But I knew right then I'd never get hit again<br>
                                    When he said to me<br>
                                    "Wait in the truck<br>
                                    Just wait in the truck"<br>
                                    Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came<br>
                                    So I kicked in his double-wide door<br>
                                    I let the hammer drop before he got<br>
                                    To that 12 he was reaching for<br>
                                    I didn't try to hide my pistol<br>
                                    I didn't even try to run<br>
                                    I just sat on the porch, smoking one of his cigarettes<br>
                                    And waited for the cops to come<br>
                                    I don't know if he's an angel<br>
                                    'Cause angels don't do what he did<br>
                                    He was hellbent to find the man behind<br>
                                    All the whiskey scars I hid<br>
                                    I never thought my day of justice<br>
                                    Would come from a judge under a seat<br>
                                    But I knew right then I'd never get hit again<br>
                                    When he said to me<br>
                                    "Wait in the truck<br>
                                    Just wait in the truck"<br>
                                    Whoa (whoa)<br>
                                    Have mercy on me, Lord<br>
                                    Have mercy on me<br>
                                    Have mercy on me (hey), Lord<br>
                                    It's been 60 months and she still comes<br>
                                    To see me from time to time<br>
                                    It was worth the price, to see a brighter side<br>
                                    Of the girl I picked up that night<br>
                                    And I might be here forever<br>
                                    It ain't paradise, that's true<br>
                                    But it's whole hell of a lot better<br>
                                    Than the place I sent him to, yeah<br>
                                    Wait in the truck (have mercy on me)<br>
                                    Just wait in the truck<br>
                                    (Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me)<br>
                                    Wait in the truck (Lord, have mercy)<br>
                                    Just wait in the truck<br>
                                    have mercy on me, Lord<br>
                                    Have mercy on me<br>
                                    (Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) have mercy on me, Lord<br>
                                    Have mercy on me<br>
                                    (Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) wait in the truck<br>

                                    It's a beautiful day, she's been crying all night<br>
                                    Aw, there's tears in her blue, bloodshot in mine<br>
                                    This bender's been bending, it's hell bound to break<br>
                                    My baby's had all she can take<br>
                                    Mister, I'll take your roses<br>
                                    If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more<br>
                                    I'll buy violets and daisies to hide all the crazy, it's gonna take all you've

                                    Well, I took some pills, and she took the dogs<br>
                                    Aw, it's all gone to hell, she's gone to her mom's<br>
                                    And I took up drinking since she took the time<br>
                                    To tell me I took the best years of her life<br>
                                    So, buddy, I'll take your roses<br>
                                    If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more<br>

                                    Roses are red, violets are blue<br>
                                    I don't need one, I need one million to get you<br>
                                    So, mister, I'll take your roses<br>
                                    If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more<br>

                            of heartbreak and moving on. The lyrics tell the story of a person who has decided to leave
                            behind
                            a relationship that has caused pain. With soulful vocals and emotional lyrics, this song is
                            a
                            powerful expression of personal growth and independence.</p>

                                    First time I heard this song it reminded me of seeing Stapleton and Timberlake blow
                                    up the world of country music. Unbelievable voice.</p>

                                    Got a head full of noise<br>
                                    About a hundred different things I'm tryna avoid<br>
                                    I got a mind in the gutter<br>
                                    Got trouble on one hand, a beer in the other<br>
                                    Got the windows down and my fingers crossed<br>
                                    Just lookin' for a brand new way to get lost<br>
                                    So long, four wheels turning<br>
                                    Got a tank full of gas, down the road, I'm burning<br>
                                    Can't say I would and I can't say I wouldn't<br>
                                    If I don't come back, don't come lookin'<br>
                                    Feels good, about time<br>
                                    Blue skies ahead and B-S behind<br>
                                    Got the wind in my hair<br>
                                    I got nowhere to go so I'm already there<br>
                                    And maybe Moab, maybe the Rockies<br>
                                    Maybe the Great Salt Plains, or the hills of Kentucky<br>
                                    Maybe North or maybe South<br>
                                    I don't care as long as it's now<br>
                                    So long, four wheels turning<br>

                                    If you wanna get down tonight<br>
                                    Come on<br>
                                    If you're lookin' for a real good time<br>
                                    Come on<br>

                                Met him at a party, accidentally brushed his body<br>
                                On the way to get a drink at the bar<br>
                                I couldn't wait 'til later, talking in the elevator<br>
                                Then we're kissing in the back of the car<br>
                                That voice in my head says to slow down<br>
                                But it can't see the way you're looking at me right now<br>
                                It may not be next week, what I need<br>
                                Then again, maybe it might be<br>
                                Could be forever or we might break<br>
                                That's just the kind of risk that we take<br>
                                My head is yelling that I could get hurt<br>
                                But I'm gonna jump right in<br>
                                Baby, with my heart first<br>
                                I gotta have ya, gotta see if this works<br>
                                I gotta have ya, wake up in your t-shirt<br>
                                Who knows what'll happen, ain't that always kinda magic<br>
                                When you don't know who's holding the cards<br>
                                Could be a wish I never knew ya or permanently tattoo ya<br>
                                Only the moon knows what's in the stars (what's in the stars)<br>

                            heartbroken narrator feeling the urge to change the station anytime a Strait song plays.
                            This became one of the biggest chart hits of McCreery’s 11-year career.</p>

                                    That was her favorite song<br>
                                    She sang along every time it came on<br>
                                    First time we danced was to Marina Del Rey<br>
                                    And I fell right there and then<br>
                                    I didn't want that song to end<br>
                                    Baby blue was the color of her eyes<br>
                                    I can still see them in my mind<br>
                                    Probably will for the rest of my life<br>

                                    You know I've always been your biggest fan<br>
                                    Now I can't even listen<br>
                                    'Cause I'll get to missin' her<br>

                                    I couldn't turn it off fast enough<br>
                                    I tried to get back in the game<br>
                                    But this ole heart just ain't the same<br>
