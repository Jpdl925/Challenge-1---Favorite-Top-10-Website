Peer review - David Jimenez - I like how you both use the modal component of Bootstrap to show the video as well as the lyrics, release info and more info about the song for each song.  Duc, I noticed that you may need to add a rewview video to your items instead of a regular music / music video.  Julius, I saw that you will want to formatt the titales / headers of each bit of info to be bold instead of regular font.
